# Key Cracking

### Phrasen|drescher 
JtR is not able to crack some/recently generated keys, but I've had good luck
using either hashcat or phrasen|drescher.  Phrasen|drescher is archived here as 
it's home is unmaintaned and could go away at any time.  This tool is easier
to use than hashcat, but you'll have to compile it.
