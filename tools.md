# Key Cracking

### Phrasendrescher 
JtR is not able to crack some/recently generated keys, but I've had good luck
using either hashcat or phrasendrescher.  Phrasendrescher is archived here as 
it's home is unmaintaned and could go away at any time.  This tool is easier
to use than hashcat, but you'll have to compile it.
